# byobash-demo

**Give you the Python you need to welcome you competently into Sh work**


## Demo script

Try it, you'll like it

Take Sh Input Lines like these

    git clone https://github.com/pelavarre/byobash-demo.git
    cd byobash-demo/

    make
    make help
    make push

    bin/ls.py
    bin/ls.py --h
    bin/ls.py --

    bin/ls.py -1
    bin/ls.py -1 --ext=.py
    bin/ls.py -1 --e >p.py && python3 p.py
    cat p.py

Trying those Sh Input Lines produces Sh Transcripts such as

## Your turn now

Fork it, edit it, and you'll like it more

1 Put your own 'ls' examples into your own:  bin/ls.py
<br>
2 Put your own 'ls' notes into your own:  bin/ls.py --h
<br>
3 Put your own 'ls' defaults into your own:  bin/ls.py --
<br>
4 Add your own translations to Python from Bash into your own:  bin/ls.py --ext=.py ...

P.S.

To keep your 'ls.py' available to your Sh Terminal inside other Dirs,
you can add these Py Files into your Sh Path, through some such '~/.bashrc' patch as

    export PATH="${PATH:+$PATH:}$HOME/Public/byobash-demo/bin"
